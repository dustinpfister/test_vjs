# js-javascript-example-idle-game-simple-mine

The goal here is to just make a very simple run of the mill mine theme idle game involving ships that move from a home base to a mine location and back again. There is more to it than just that though of course, I started this project out keeping the idea of away production in mind, along with many other basic features that I might get around to adding if I keep working on this example. I do not want to get to involve in this example though, as I would like to keep this game some what simple if I can.
