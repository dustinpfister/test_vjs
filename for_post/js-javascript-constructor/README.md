# js-javascript-constructor

In this folder I have my source code examples that I write about in my post on [javaScript constructors](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/02/27/js-javascript-constructor/). A constructor function in javaScript is a function that is called with the new keyword to create an instance of a cretin type of an object. For example the Date constructor is a kind of built in constructor function that is called with the new keyword, the returned result is then an instance of the Date constructor or class if you prefer.
