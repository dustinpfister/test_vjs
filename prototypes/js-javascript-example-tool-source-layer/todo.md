## ( ) - r1 - custom bgMode

## ( ) - r0 - Basic idea working
* have a canvas element that will serve as a 'source layer'
* have a canvas element on top of the source layer that will serve as a 'draw layer'
* have a div area that will serve as a ui for the 'source layer'
* use the file input element type to load and image to draw in the 'source layer'
* for now have it so that each mouse or touch move while down will cause a circle to draw there with a single color
