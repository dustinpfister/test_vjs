# js-javascript-example-grid-game-unit-movement

This is the source code for a simple turn based game based off of what I worked out for my blog [post on a javaScript grid unit movement example](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2020/08/11/js-javascript-example-grid-game-unit-movement/). I would like to not turn that example into a full game of any kind, leaving the focus mainly on just moving units around in a game world map. However with this javaScript example the aim is to very much build on top of that source code to create an example that is beginning to look more like some kind of final product of some kind in the form of a turn based Role Playing Game of some kind.

For now I do not have any final name for this game just yet, as I think that will be part of what I would want to do when it comes to making yet another project based off of this source code. However I do intend to work out as much as I can when it comes to the various other aspects of a game like this beyond just that of unit movement. That means having things like a half way decent system for storing scene data with the various game worlds, a menu system and user interface for switching between various kinds of in game menus, an item system including a database of items and item classes, and so forth.
