# js-call-apply-and-bind

These are the source code examples for my blog post on the [Function Prototype methods](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2017/09/21/js-call-apply-and-bind/). This includes methods like call, apply, and bind that can be used to set what the value of the this keyword is when calling a function. So then there are lots of examples that uses these various methods to choose form, but there are also a lot of examples in which I am just touching on related topics to call, and apply. It is after all a good idea to have a solid understand of what the this keyword is all about, as well as know a thing or two about prototype methods and classes.
