// this is the first basic example I had for the js-math-log post
console.log(Math.pow(Math.E,Math.log(1000))); // 999.99...

// working out something a litter different here
// but be sure to look at what is in the new s*_* folders
var l = Math.log(1000),
e = Math.E,
n = Math.pow(e, l);

console.log(l);
console.log(e);
console.log(n);
