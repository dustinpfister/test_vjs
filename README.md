# test_vjs

These are a bunch of original vanilla javaScript demos that I worked out for content on [my site here](https://dustinpfister.github.io/) at github pages, mainly my [js](https://dustinpfister.github.io/categories/js/) and some on my [canvas](https://dustinpfister.github.io/categories/canvas/) collections of content. In some cases some of these demos might also include the use of additional external resources outside of native javaScript by itself, but the goal is to avoid doing so, and focus mostly on the language itself.

## The for post folder

This folder contains javaScript examples that should be featured in a corresponding blog post on my website. As such these examples should be more or less done, and in decent working order, or failing that are at least in a state of compleation that I can write a one thousand plus word post on. So it is still possible that there might be at least a few bugs in the code of these various examples that I have not got around to adressing just yet. Speaking of that I do get around to editing both the blog post as well as take a second look at the source code examples also now and then, and as such I do get around to fixing things. With that said if you do fine something there is making a pull request here, as well as leaving a comment in the coresponding blog post also as another option when it comes to bring soemthing up.

## The prototypes folder

This folder contains prototypes for javaScript project examples that may or may not be featured in a blog post at some point in the future. Many of these might exist in various degrees of completion, some might just be readme files that outline what the general idea is.
