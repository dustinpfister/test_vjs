# js-javascript-example-grid-game-unit-movement

This is the source code for a simple turn based game based off of what I worked out for my blog [post on a javaScript grid unit movement example](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2020/08/11/js-javascript-example-grid-game-unit-movement/). I would like to not turn that example into a full game of any kind, leaving the focus mainly on just moveing units around in a game world map. However with this javaScript example that aim is to very much build on top of that source code to create an example that is begining to look more like some kind of final product of some kind.
