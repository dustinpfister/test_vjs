# js-javascript-if

This is what I have together in terms of source code examples for my [post on if statements in core javaScript, as well as other control flow related topics](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/02/25/js-javascript-if/). The basics of if statements alone are simple enough, but there is a bit more to cover when it comes to control flow in general. There is not just if statements alone after all but also, conditional operators, switch statements, loops, state machines, and any and all other ways to go about controlling the flow of code.
