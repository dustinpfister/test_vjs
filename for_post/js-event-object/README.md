# js-event-object

This is a collection of javaScript source code examples that have to do with [event objects in native javaScript](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2020/07/23/js-event-object/). These are the kinds of objects that are passed to a callback function for an event hander such as one that is attached to an on click event in client side javaScript.
