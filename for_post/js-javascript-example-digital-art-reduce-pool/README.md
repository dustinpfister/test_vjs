# js-example-digital-art-reduce-pool

This is the first of what might be a few javaScript examples of digital art, starting with one that is an idea that came to me when editing my post on the array reduce method. The general idea of this is to just have a pool of objects that will reduce by merging with each other, and then there is a way for them to split back into more than one again. Aside from just making a digital art project there are some additional intensions with this that have to do with the idea of just finishing a project. My keeping the main idea of what somehting is very simple that will allow for the main idea to be compleated fairly fast such as in a few days. After that is is just a matter of what more I want to add in terms of additional features, and then after that it is a question of improveing the state of the source code without adding additonal complexity. You see there are certin habits that I would like to break, and I would like to start out by breaking them with something that is fairly simple, such as a digital air thing that is just a bunch of display objects moving a round and then combine into each other and break apart again.

## Minimum Viable Product versions (r0 to r4)

A Minimum Viable Product is a term given for a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development. This example is just a simple digital art type thing, but still the general idea is the same when it comes to just getting togetaher what the core of product is first and formost. As of revision 4 of this example the general idea of what I wanted to do is done. However just becuase soemthing is done, and even if something is indeed up and running and seems to work the way i want it to, that does not mean that there is nothing wrong with it. Also the general core set of features alone might prove to be kind of bland, and as such additonal features might help to make the project more intertesing. Still then general idea is to first figure out what the MVP for short is, and get the done first and formost.

### r0 - first state of example

With r0 I started out with a the object pool librra from my turn based rpg example, and various ushual suspect methods in a custom utilties libraray. At this point I also started the first state of the main.js, game.js, and draw.js files.

### r1 - unit modes, and mass transfer over time

### r2 - split mode, transfer rate

### r3 - seek units, unit mass fix

### r4 - enter split delay, move to center fix, colors

## Software Architecture ( r? to r? )
