## Canvas Example Particles Binary todo list

* make it so that when two particles hit each other one becomes inactive, and then other enters '11' bits state
* once a particle is in '11' bits state I will explode and become inactive after it runs out of life
* a '11' bits state partice has its radius grow from a min to max as it dies
* a '11' bits state orb has its pps set to zero

* (done) clean starting point
* (done) particles.js: start a particles.js file
* (done) particles.js: private method to create a single particle object
* (done) particles.js: private method to create a pool of particle objects
* (done) particles.js: public method to create a state object
* (done) particles.js: public method to update, or tick a state object
* (done) use particles.js in main.js to create, and update the state object.
