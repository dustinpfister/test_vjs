# js-call-apply-and-bind

These are the source code examples for my blog post on the [Function Prototype methods](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2017/09/21/js-call-apply-and-bind/). This includes methods like call, apply, and bind that can be used to set what the value of the this keyword is when calling a function. So then there are lots of examples that uses these various methods to choose form, but there are also a lot of examples in which I am just touching on related topics to call, and apply. It is after all a good idea to have a solid understand of what the this keyword is all about, as well as know a thing or two about prototype methods and classes.

## The basic section of the post

The basic section of the post should include at least one or more examples of at least one of the Function prototype methods such as call. However the main focus of the basics section should be one what a developer should know before reading the rest of the post. In the advanced sections I can get into the call methods in detail, and do the same for apply and bind if need be.

## Advanced sections

I think there shroud be an advanced section for each function prototype method, that is one for call, one for apply, and one for bind. All the additional advanced sections should be on various tricks, related topics, and things to look out for when using these methods with things.

## Example Sections

As of this writing I have just one example section at the end of the post that is a code example that can be used to get a quick crude word count for a post. This is something that I should expand in future edits of course.
