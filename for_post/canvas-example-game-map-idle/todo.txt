* debug draw method for building state
* corresponding draw methods for all state events
* combine draw_map.js into draw.js



### map.js
<!-- *************************************** -->
* remove everything for device pixel ratio
* change global variable from 'g' to 'map'
* map starts out centered
* status bar displays current tick progress
* info display when any tile is selected
