# server-demo

This is a script to just serve a demo by way of http rather than file prototcol.

## How to use

Start with node and give a port number or else the default of 8080 will be used

```
$ node server.js 8000
```

Then go to a url like this in the browser

```
http://localhost:8080/demos/loader/index.html
```

replace loader with the desired demo in the demos folder
