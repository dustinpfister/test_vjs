# js-javascript-constructor

In this folder I have my source code examples that I write about in my post on [javaScript constructors](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/02/27/js-javascript-constructor/). A constructor function in javaScript is a function that is called with the new keyword to create an instance of a cretin type of an object. For example the Date constructor is a kind of built in constructor function that is called with the new keyword, the returned result is then an instance of the Date constructor or class if you prefer. There is not just making use of Built in javaScript constructors like Date, and Array though, there is also how to go about creating ones own constructor functions by just write function expressions or declarations and using the this keyword in the body of the function to refer to the own properties of the object that will be the instance of the constructor.
