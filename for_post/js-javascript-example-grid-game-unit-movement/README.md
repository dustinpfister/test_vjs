# js-javascript-example-grid-game-unit-movement

This is the source code folder for the javaScript example that I am writing about in my [post on javaScript grid unit movement](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2020/08/11/js-javascript-example-grid-game-unit-movement/). The style of unit movement in this example has to do with a kind of turn based system rather than a real time system of some kind. So then this is in no way any kind of definitive example of unit movement in a client side javaScript game, by rather just one system for a certain kind of game, and even with this it might not be the best choice for all projects.

The example first started out as just a simple system involving the position of a player unit in a grid, and just moving that player unit by figuring out what the angle is from the current positon and a position that was clicked by making use of the [Math.atan2 method](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/03/19/js-math-atan2/).
