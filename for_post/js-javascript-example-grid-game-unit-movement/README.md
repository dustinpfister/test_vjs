# js-javascript-example-grid-game-unit-movement

This is the source code folder for the javaScript example that i am writing about in my [post on javaScript grid unit movement](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2020/08/11/js-javascript-example-grid-game-unit-movement/). The style of unit movement in this example has to do with a kind of turn based system rather than a real time system of some kind.
