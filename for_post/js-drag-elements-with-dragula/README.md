# js-drag-elements-with-dragula

This is what I have together for an old [post of mine on using a library called dragula](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2017/12/04/js-drag-elements-with-dragula/) to drag html elements around a page. This is one way to go about dragging around elements in client side javaScript, and the projects seems to work fairly well. Also as of this writing it would seem that the project is still supported as of 2021 at least which is also cool.

However at this time I am sure that there are also great native, browser built in features for this sort of thing also now.
