# js-array-fill

This is what I have when it comes to examples that have to do with filling an array of a fixed static value, or just filling an array in general actually to which I write about in detail in [my blog post on this topic](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2020/04/23/js-array-fill/). There is a native javaScript method for this sort of thing now called the array fill method which is not just on of many other methods in the core javaScript array prototype. So then it goes without saying that I have an examples or two that makes use of that method. However I also took the time to explore this topic in further detail when it comes to all kinds of other ways that one might want to fill an array. For example that is creating a new array with numbers that start at a given value and then go up from there, finning an array with random values in various kinds of forms, and also creating a new filled array from a given source value such as a string and so forth.
