# js-string-match

This is a collection of examples on the [String.match method](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/04/06/js-string-match/) that can be used to find one or more matches of a regular expression in a String. The String match method will return null if no match is found, and an array of objects for the one or more matched that are found when something is found depending on the source sting, and the flags set for the pattern.
