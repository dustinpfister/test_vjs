# js-array

I have [wrote a post that is a general overview of arrays](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/12/10/js-array/), and all kinds of various topics that branch off from arrays in javaScript. I get around to editing and expanding the post now and then, and have done so a fair number of times thus far. As such it would seem that this post is starting to turn into one of my long form posts on javaScript. This for post folder in my test vjs repository is then the collection of source code examples that I have together thus far on this main, central post on javaScript arrays. Many of the source code examples focus on arrays them selfs, such as how to created them, and how to make use of the various array prototype method that there are to work with. However I am also getting into all kinds of various topics in core javaScript that are related to the use of arrays such as the Object.keys static method that can be used as a way to create an array of public key names from any object, and the various string methods such as split that can be used to create an array from a string.
