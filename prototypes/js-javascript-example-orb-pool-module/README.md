# js-javascript-example-orb-pool-module

This example is just me building on top of my pool.js and orb.js modules to create a orbpool.js module that I was intending to use in at least one if not more games. The present state of this prototype is in limbo as I am not sure of this is the direction I want to go in when it comes to making this kind of module.
