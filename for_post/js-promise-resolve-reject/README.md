# js-promise-resolve-reject

These are some source code examples that have to do with the [Promise.resolve and Promise.reject static methods as well as the resolve and reject methods called inside the body of functions that are passed to the Promise Constructor](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/09/18/js-promise-resolve-reject/). I am also taking a moment to go over promises in general while I am at it in an effort to get more into depth about what the whole resolve and reject thing is with promises.
