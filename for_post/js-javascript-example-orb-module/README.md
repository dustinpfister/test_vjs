# js-javascript-example-orb-module

This is the source code for my orb module that I would like to use in at least one if not more games. The general idea is to have an orb object that is the combination of one or more elements, such as four elements. When it comes to this there is the current point array of elements that is how many of each element composes the current orb, there is then also the simple ratio of these point values. The simple ratio can be used as a way to find what _type_ of orb an orb object is, and the count of how many times the simple ratio is of the points can be used as a way to find a level of the orb. This can then result in all kinds of interesting possibles when it comes to making orb types, especially when it comes to the idea of making a database of orb types that follow an kind of _recipe_ type.
