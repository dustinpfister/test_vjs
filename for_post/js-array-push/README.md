# js-array-push

These are the source code examples that I am writing about in my post on the [array push method](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2020/06/17/js-array-push/). The array push method is just one of several ways of going about pushing one or more new elements into an array. The array push method will append one or more elements to the end of the array from which it is called in the from of function arguments.

On top of the array push method there are also methods like the array unshift method that will do more or less the same as push only append the new elements given at the beginning of the array. There is also the array splice method that can be sud as one option for injecting elements at any given element index location of an array.

All the other source code examples in the post have to do with other ways of creating a new array form one or more source arrays rather than just adding one or more elements at the end.
