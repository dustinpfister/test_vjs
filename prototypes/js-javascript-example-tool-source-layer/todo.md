## ( ) - r1 - bgMode modes starting with 'custom'
* start bgModes starting with a custom mode that should be able to set anything
* have text input elements for sx, sy, sw, sh, dx, dy, dw, and dh


## ( ) - r0 - Basic idea working
* (done) have a canvas element that will serve as a 'source layer'
* (done) have a div area that will serve as a ui for the 'source layer'
* (done) use the file input element type to load and image to draw in the 'source layer'

* have a canvas element on top of the source layer that will serve as a 'draw layer'
* for now have it so that each mouse or touch move while down will cause a circle to draw there with a single color
