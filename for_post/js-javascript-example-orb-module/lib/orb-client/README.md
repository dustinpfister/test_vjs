# orb.js - client version

This is what should be the current client side version of the orb module based off of what I first worked out in the root of this lib folder. The module is based off of the client side version of my ratio.js module, and makes use of methods in that lib to create and update the properties if a single orb object. This is the version that I will be working on first and foremost when it comes to continuing to move forward with this project when ti comes to adding any additional features for this module.
