# test_vjs

These are a bunch of original vanilla javaScript demos that I worked out for content on [my site here](https://dustinpfister.github.io/) at github pages, mainly my [js](https://dustinpfister.github.io/categories/js/) and [canvas](https://dustinpfister.github.io/categories/canvas/) collections of content. In some cases some of these demos might also include the use of additional external resources outside of native javaScript by itself, but the goal is to avoid doing so.

## The for post folder

This folder contains javaScript examples that should be featured in a corresponding blog post on my website. As such these examples should be more or less done, and in decent working order. However it is still possible that there might be a few bugs in the code.

## The prototypes folder

This folder contains prototypes for javaScript project examples that may or may not be featured in a blog post at some point in the future. Many of these might exist in various degrees of completion, some might just be readme files that outline what the general idea is.
