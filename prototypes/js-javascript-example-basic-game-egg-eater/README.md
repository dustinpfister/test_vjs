# js-javascript-example-basic-game-egg-eater

I think I will start a few examples that are very basic games. Nothing over the top, just keeping things very simple, that way they can be put togetaher real fast. Also they can serve as great starting points for learning how to create games with javaScript and canvas elements.

The idea for this game is to just have a bunch of display objects come from a starting point in the canvas and then go to another location on the canvas. They player can then just click the canvas or not, when the canvas is being clicked these display objects will be 'eaten' and the player will gain a score. However there is another kind of display object that is eaten will result in game over. So then the regular display objects are eggs, and then the game over object can be thought of as a bomb or something to that effect.
