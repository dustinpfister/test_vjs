# js-example-digital-art-reduce-pool

This is the first of what might be a few javaScript examples of digital art, starting with one that is an idea that came to me when editing my post on the array reduce method. The general idea of this is to just have a pool of objects that will reduce by merging with each other, and then there is a way for them to split back into more than one again. Aside from just making a digital art project there are some additional intensions with this that have to do with the idea of just finishing a project. My keeping the main idea of what somehting is very simple that will allow for the main idea to be compleated fairly fast such as in a few days. After that is is just a matter of what more I want to add in terms of additional features, and then after that it is a question of improveing the state of the source code without adding additonal complexity. You see there are certin habits that I would like to break, and I would like to start out by breaking them with something that is fairly simple, such as a digital air thing that is just a bunch of display objects moving a round and then combine into each other and break apart again.
