# js-javascript-example-pool-normalized

When working on my digital art invaders JavaScript example one nice thing that came of that while working on that was a new object pool library that I have been calling pool-normalized. I then thought that I should start a new prototype for a javaScript example that is just the current state of this new object pool. While I am at it I would also want to create a simple, clean, start point for a demo of this library.

So then this would end up being a project in which the MVP is all ready done basically, sense all I have to do is opy over the pool-normalized file, and just create a clean striped down demo of the library. That then just leaves the question of what any additional features of the library should be when it comes to the core of the library, as this is not a chances to make any additional changes that should happen to the core of what this is before going nuts with additional projects based off of this.
