# js-javascript-example-digital-art-invaders

This is yet another one of my digital art javaScript examples this time it is a simple project involving invading display objects that move in to a loctation in which there are other stationary display objects that are to be destroyed. These statioary display objects also fight back the invadiors 

This is the third digital art project example, continuing with a trend that I think I think is working out well so far when it comes to planing out a project in a way where there is a clear idea as to how long it will take to make.


## General Idea or Minimum Viable Product ( r0 - rx )

### r0 - Start project, and units.js

When I first started this project I copied what I had for revision 4 of my unsteady stars example, and then striped that down to a crude starting point. Off of that I started a new units.js library as I would like to start a new system for this sort of thing while working on this project.
