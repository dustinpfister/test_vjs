# js-example-digital-art-reduce-pool

This is the first of what might be a few javaScript examples of digital art, starting with one that is an idea that came to me when editing my post on the array reduce method. The general idea of this is to just have a pool of objects that will reduce by merging with each other, and then there is a way for them to split back into more than one again. Aside from just making a digital art project there are some additional intension's with this that have to do with the idea of just finishing a project. My keeping the main idea of what something is very simple that will allow for the main idea to be complicated fairly fast such as in a few days. After that is is just a matter of what more I want to add in terms of additional features, and then after that it is a question of improving the state of the source code without adding additional complexity. You see there are certain habits that I would like to break, and I would like to start out by breaking them with something that is fairly simple, such as a digital air thing that is just a bunch of display objects moving a round and then combine into each other and break apart again.

## Minimum Viable Product versions (r0 to r4)

A Minimum Viable Product is a term given for a version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development. This example is just a simple digital art type thing, but still the general idea is the same when it comes to just getting together what the core of product is first and foremost. As of revision 4 of this example the general idea of what I wanted to do is done. However just because something is done, and even if something is indeed up and running and seems to work the way i want it to, that does not mean that there is nothing wrong with it. Also the general core set of features alone might prove to be kind of bland, and as such additional features might help to make the project more interesting. Still then general idea is to first figure out what the MVP for short is, and get the done first and foremost.

### r0 - first state of example

With r0 I started out with a the object pool library from my turn based rpg example, and various usual suspect methods in a custom utilities library. At this point I also started the first state of the main.js, game.js, and draw.js files.

### r1 - unit modes, and mass transfer over time

### r2 - split mode, transfer rate

### r3 - seek units, unit mass fix

### r4 - enter split delay, move to center fix, colors


## Some Additional Features, fixes and general changes (r5 to - )

Now that the Core idea, Minimum Viable Product, or whatever you want to call it is done. The next step is adding additional features that will make this digital art project, well more interesting as that is what the point of such a project is.

### r5 - New background, poolMod update hooks

### r6 - Wind feature

Use it or loose it, by fixing a bug, or turning it into a feature actually.

### r7 - Points

### r8 - Grid lines moving with Wind

## Software Architecture ( r9 to r? )

Software architecture refers to how software is structured, and can be thought of as the discipline of creating software structures and systems. In other words the term architecture for short often may refer to how one would go about answering the question of how one would go about creating, and maintaining a software system that may ultimately consist of thousands, if not millions of lines of code. This is just a silly artful thing, but never the less there is taking a moment to look over the state of the source code, and make changes that will result in the same outcome, but the state of the source code is easy to follow and debug. Speaking of bugs there is also identifying know issues and seeing about fixing those issues.

So then from this point forward any and all additional revisions will have to do with just making changes that are just better ways of doing the same thing. Changes that do not result in any kind of new feature as the basic idea with this is done, and all the additional features I wanted to add are also done at this point. However there is making the source code more readable, more efficient, and also fixing any and all known bugs. 

### r9 -
