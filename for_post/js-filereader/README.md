# js-filereader

The [FileReader constructor](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2020/03/24/js-filereader/) in client side javaScript is a way to read files that may be stored on a local file system but allowing the user to find and select a file to read. This can then be used as yet another way to load and save state beyond just using cookie files, and local storage.
