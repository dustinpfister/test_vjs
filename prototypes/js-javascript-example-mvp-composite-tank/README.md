# js-javascript-example-mvp-composite-tank

This aims to be a game prototype where I figure out all the features that I want to have before I even get started. That is to just start out with this README file, and also a todo list. In fact for the most part I think it is best to start oiut with a todo list first, and then expand this read me file as I actually work on the prototype.

The General idea that I had for this game was to have a simple game where player units will be fixed at the bottom of the canvas and enemy units will come down from the top of the canvas in the direction of the player units at the bottom. This is not because the player units are static but because the player is progressing forward, so the movement of any background can help to show that is the case. Anyway the real core idea of this is that these tanks and composite tanks, in other worlds they are not just one display unit but a few display objects attached to a root or parent unit. These composite parts can then be things like player controlled turrets that will fire only when the player clicks somewhere on the canvas, as well as auto turrets that will automatically select a target and fire.
