# js-javascript-alert

When first starting out with javaScript I often was learning how to print some output by way of using the alert method in client side javaScript. Although this might be fine when it comes to first starting out with javaScript, typically it is prefered to find outher ways to go about printing output in a client side of nodejs enviorment when working with a little javaScript code. This folder is a collection of source code exmaples that I am writing about in [my post on the javaScript alert method]() as well as the various other options for creating some output for things that are going on in a little javaScript code.
