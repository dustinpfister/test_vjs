<!-- Maintenance -->

## () - rx - json input validation
* I will want an input validation helper

<!-- Additional Features -->

## () - rx - points, and line rotation

## () - rx - points.js
* start a points.js file that will contain methods to create and mutate points

<!-- Minimum Viable Product -->

## () - r4 - FileReader api to load background image
* I will want at least two canvas elements, one for the background and another for the points
* use the FileReader api to load an image and use that as a the content of a background canvas

## () - r3 - FileReader api to load and save points
* load and save points using FileReader api

## () - r2 - point, and line indices Selection system
* select a single line of a points array
* can move a whole line
* Select a single index value in a single line that will be a current point index value
* can move a single point of a single line

## () - r1 - text area element
* (done) have a text area element that can be used to create a points array with text
* (done) any change to the text area input area will update the canvas if it is valid
* (done) any change to a tab will update the text content to the current project
* (done) if more than one object in a project draw them all

* See if I can get JSON.stringify working the way I would like it to


## ( done 01/18/2022) - r0 - Start with draw points example code, sm.tab and Project object started
* (done) start out with the system that I worked out for my js-javascript-example-draw-points post
* (done) use the draw points method from js-javascript-example-draw-points post in draw.js
* (done) have an sm.tab array that will be an array of loaded points projects
* (done) each element in a tab array wil then be a Project object
* (done) a Project object will contain a fileName prop
* (done) a project object will contain an array of points arrays
* (done) have a collection of tabs above the canvas that can be used to switch between tabs
