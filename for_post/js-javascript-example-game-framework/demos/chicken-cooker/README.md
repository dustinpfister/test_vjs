# chicken-cooker

I wanted to make at least one demo of this grame framework that is not just a demo, but something that is at least starting to look like a done game project of some kind. The idea for this demo then is a very basic game where chickens spawn in from an outer radius outside the bounds of a stack of canvas elements. The chickens then move in to an inner radius, and then move around randomly within this inner radius. The player can then click locations on the canvas to cause a blast, and then any chickens in that blast radius will become cooked chickens. The cooked chickens then add to the score of the game, and that is about it.
