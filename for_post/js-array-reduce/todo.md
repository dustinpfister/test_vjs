## () - new canvas example of reduce
* start a new canvas example section of array reduce
* The example should have an object 'pool', and reduce is used to manage a 'active' selection of objects
* any active object will have its radius, and alpha values to up to a max
* any pool object that is not active will have alpha and radius values reduce to zero
* calls of reduce will on occasions actuality increase the size of the active array, but only up to  max that is the length of the pool
