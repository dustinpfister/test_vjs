# js-javascript-example-mvp-little-city

I would like a very basic city simulator game like that of sim city classic, but I am not sure if I will even want to create all the features that are found in that game actually at least when it comes to the MVP of the game at least. Speaking of Minimal Viable Product that is also one of the core thems with this, to just start out with a striped down, simple core of what the game should be with the smallest possible set of features. One major problem with this is even that might still prove to be a fair amount of work, but never the less that is what I want to do with this project.

## Zone Types

When it comes to zone types I think that I am going to want to just start out with three, residential, commercial, and road. That is becuase I think that one of the main starting points here is to figure out what land value should be for each cell, and as such land value will also in turn determine a lot more about the city in terms of population, Mean Income of that population, and thus also Tax revenue.

* (done r0) 'res' cells that are cells that are zoned as residential areas of a game map where people live
* (done r0) 'com' cells that are cells in a map that are zoned for commercial use
* (done r0) 'road' cells which as the name imples are just simply roads that are used in path to determine land value

## Cell data props

When it comes to cell data object properties for now I am thinking that land value, population, and a delta value for population are good starting points for this kind of game. In time there are a lot more properties that I might want to have on a cell by cell basis such as crime, polution, and so forth, however I think much of that will extend beyond that of what the scope of an MVP would be.

* (done r0) landValue
* (done r0) population
* (done r0) popDelta
