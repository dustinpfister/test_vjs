# js-array-reduce

This is the collection of examples that I have for my [post on the array reduce](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2021/07/13/js-array-reduce/) method. When it comes to lodash there is also the lodash reduce method that is just like array reduce but it is a collection method that will work with objects in general. With that said there is not just writing about the array reduce method alone, but various other core javaScript features that can be used to get array reduce to work with various other kinds of objects and values other than that of arrays.
