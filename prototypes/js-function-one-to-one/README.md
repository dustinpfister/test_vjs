# js-function-one-to-one

A one to one function is a term that may refer to a function to which there is just one, and only one, value that is returned for all possible values that can be passed as an argument. Another term that might be used to descript this kind of function is a strictly incressing monotonic function, although I supose a strictly decressing montoinc function may be another term that would fit this kind of defanition also.
