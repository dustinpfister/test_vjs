# js-javascript-example-pool-normalized

When working on my digital art invaders javascript example one nice thing that came of that while workin gon that was a new object pool library that I have been calling pool-normalized. I then thought that I should start a new prototype for a javaScript exampke that is just the current state of this new object pool as well as maybe one or two additional projects based off of this project.
