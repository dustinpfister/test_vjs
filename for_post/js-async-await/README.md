# js-async-await

This is a collection of source code examples that have to do with the use of async await and async style javaScript in general. Much of what I have here I am writing about in my corresponding [blog post on sync await](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/06/25/js-async-await/). The thing about these kinds of functions is that from what I have found is that they are just another tool in the tool box when it comes to working within a single event loop. As such these kinds of functions are not a replacement for client side javaScript features like Web Worker, and nodejs features like the spawn method in the child process module as those are ways of spinning up a whole other event loop.
