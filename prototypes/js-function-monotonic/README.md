# js-function-monotonic

I should have a few examples of monotonic functions, and also non monotonic functions while I am at it to have something to compare to. It would seem that in layman terms a _monotonically-strictly-increasing_ function is a function where the return value of the function will always go up in value for as a given argument value. This way there is no possibly that the same value will be returned for any two sets of arguments when calling the function. There are a number of other terms for this kind of function when it comes to slightly different rules, but that would be the most note worthy definition of this kind of function when it comes to my experience with writing these kinds of functions as they are an important part of designing an experience point system.
