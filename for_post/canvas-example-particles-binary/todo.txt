## Canvas Example Particles Binary todo list

* a '11' bits state particle has its radius grow from a min to max as it dies
* part that gets set to '11' state should have its position set to an an average between the two points.

* (done) make it so that when two particles hit each other one becomes inactive, and then other enters '11' bits state
* (done) once a particle is in '11' bits state I will explode and become inactive after it runs out of life
* (done) a '11' bits state orb has its pps set to zero
* (done) clean starting point
* (done) particles.js: start a particles.js file
* (done) particles.js: private method to create a single particle object
* (done) particles.js: private method to create a pool of particle objects
* (done) particles.js: public method to create a state object
* (done) particles.js: public method to update, or tick a state object
* (done) use particles.js in main.js to create, and update the state object.
* (done) draw.pariclePool method in draw.js
* (done) draw a particles.js state object in main.js
