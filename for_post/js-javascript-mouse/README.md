# js-javascript-mouse

This is an outline for what I would like to do with my [post on using a mouse when making a vanilla javaScript project](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2020/06/25/js-javascript-mouse/). I am thinking that these readme files should have a tone that has more to do with what the current state of editing is when it comes to improving the quality of the post in terms of what should happen with future edits of the content. Otherwise writing these readme files would prove to be fairly redundant, and I should stop wasting time writing them.
