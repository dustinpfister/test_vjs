<!-- Additonal Features / Maintenance -->

## () - r2 - 

## ( done 01/24/2022 ) - r1 - poolMod.clamp, and poolMod.isOnEdge
* (done) make it so that the ver string is part of the library rather than main.js
* (done) have a poolMod.clamp method for the library on top of just poolMod.wrap
* (done) have some units clamp rather than wrap in the demo
* (done) with the clamped units have them get new headings when they hit a side

<!-- MVP -->

## ( done 01/23/2022 ) - r0 - Start with clean example 
* (done) start with r5 of js-javascript-example-digital-art-invaders including pool-normalized at that state of course
* (done) remove all code that does not have to do with pool-normalized.js and have a clean start with a new main.js
* (done) the start of the demo of this should just be a bunch of units moving randomly around the canvas
* (done) use poolMod.wrap for the demo to wrap the units around when they go oyut of bounds
* (done) reduce draw.js to a more simple, minimal system for drawing the state of a pool
