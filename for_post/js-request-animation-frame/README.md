# js-request-animation-frame

These are the source code examples that I put together for my [post on the request animation frame method](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/03/13/js-request-animation-frame/) in client side javaScript. The method is used as a way to go about creating an app loop for a canvas project, and is generally a better option compared to other methods like setTimeout and SetInterval. The source code examples that out with just a few basic hello world type examples like always, and then progress into all kinds of various other topics in the advanced sections and examples sections that I will likely expand on as I come around to edit this post, and these corresponding source code examples.
