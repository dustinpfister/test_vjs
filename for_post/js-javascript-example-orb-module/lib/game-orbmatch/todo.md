### () 0.x.0 - On orb death event
* have an on orb death event that fires when orb.data.hp <=0;


### () 0.x.0 - AI Improvements II
* The AI should swap orbs between slots as needed
* in the event that the AI has \< 4 orbs remaining it should swap orbs to make sure that no player orb is out of range

### () 0.x.0 - fix bugs

* fix bug where an orb can be placed in a slot that all ready has an orb

### () 0.x.0 - AI improvements I
* The AI should swap in orbs from its pouch during aiTurn game state
* The AI should make choices when it comes to setting orbs in attackMode or not

### () 0.x.0 - recipe types started
* orb-client: to allow for injection of orb recipe defs in the from of calling a public method Orb.loadRecipe
* orb-client: make changes so that will result in orb.type being set to recipe if orb.ratio matches what is in a recipe object
* orb-client: a ref to the recipe object should be a top level prop of orb such as orb.recipeDef
* orbCollection: calls of Orb.loadRecipe can be made here, and for now they can be hard coded object literals
* orbCollection: start out with a recipe where the focus is more on attack
* orbCollection: have a recipe where the focus is more on hp
* orbCollection: the state of orb.level, and orb.recipeDef should be what has an impact on stat objects such as orb.data.attack

### () 0.x.0 - TypeKey orb definition JSON.files
* make a collection of JSON files the define what the stats are for each type, and when done this can be used for recipes too
```js
// pure typeKey example
{
    typeKey: 'pure',
    baseStats: { // how base stats values will level up (these values are effected only by level and not ratio)
        attack: {
            startValue: 1,
            deltaIncPerLevel: 1 // delta value that will be added per level
        },
        hpMax: {
            startValue: 10,
            deltaIncPerLevel: 10
        },
        heal: {
            startValue: 0.25,
            deltaIncPerLevel: 0.25
        }
    },
    elementDeltas: { // additional deltas to stats that are applyed per element
        0 : { // fire elements add to attack
            attack: 0.25
        },
        1: {},
        2: { // water elements add to hpMax, and heal
            hpMax: 5,
            heal: 0.25
        },
        3: {}
    }
}
```

### () 0.x.0 - speed stat  started
* start a speed stat that will contain props that determine who attacks first, and damage/heal/effect multipliers
* The speed of an orb determines which orb will attack/buff first
* speed will not result in additional turns for an orb, but can result in additional attacks, and buffs per turn

* start a new crafting state
* have a mainMenu state that will just be a way to progress to gameConfig, or the new crafting state

### () 0.x.0 - Main state machine, game, and gameConfig state
* start a main state machine in main.js that will have just a game, and gameConfig state for now
* the gameConfig state can be used to set the state of the player, and AI pouch
* when the player wins or looses a game they return to gameConfig state
* have a 'gameOptions' game state that can be used to leave game state

### () 0.x.0 - target selection
* target section can be a feature of orb types
* pure types can always select all orbs in range, and thus divide attack by target array length, and attack all targets pure turn
* dual types can select a single target in range that is always the most powerful orb in terms of attack
* triple types can select a single target in range that is always the weakest
* quad types can select a random count of targets in range
* recipe types can have these values set depending on the state of the recipeDef object

### () 0.x.0 - orb.data.stat.splashDamageMulti, and orb.data.stat.splashPer
* have a splash damage multi, and splash per prop added to the range stat object
* If caps are hit for range.minRange, and range.plusOnePer more earth elements still makes sense because of range.splashDamageMulti

### () 0.x.0 - minRange, and plusOnePer chance
* the range stat object can have a minRange prop which is the base range that will be set for a turn
* the range stat object can have a plusOne prop that is the chance that the effective range will be one more than the min
* the minRange stat will then have a range between 1 and 3 depending on level
* the plusOnePer change prop can then have a range between 0 and 1.
* if minRange = 3 and plusOnePer = 1 then that will result in the range always being 4
* for now have it so that the range prop starts at 1 and goes up to 4 by a given level say 100
