# js-javascript-mouse

This is an outline for what I would like to do with my [post on using a mouse when making a vanilla javaScript project](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2020/06/25/js-javascript-mouse/). I am thinking that these readme files should have a tone that has more to do with what the current state of editing is when it comes to improving the quality of the post in terms of what should happen with future edits of the content. Otherwise writing these readme files would prove to be fairly redundant, and I should stop wasting time writing them.

## 1 - The Basics section of the post

The Basics section of the post should contain some very simple examples that involve event attachment to the window object, as well as various kinds of elements. They should also contain examples that make use of the mouse client, down, up and move events at least. While I am at it there is at least touching base on all kinds of other relevant topics such as the clientX, and clientY properties of an event object for one of these events, as well as the target and currentTarget properties. However the examples should remain fairly simple as this kind of section is intended for javaScript developers that are fairly new, as well as giving a quick refresher of the simple things with mouse related tasks in client side javaScript.

## 2 - Advanced Sections of the post

After the basics section of a post I often like to have at least one if not more advanced sections. These sections can still be fairly simple as they do not have to be an actual simple project example of some kind. However it is okay if I go a little off the deep end when it comes to examples in these sections.

### 2.1 - get element relative section

This section should focus on the subject of getting a position of an element that is relative to the parent element rather than the window. Advanced topics can include making methods that will work not just with mouse events, but pointer events in general such as touch events.

### 2.2 - The on click event

This section can focus mainly on the on click event, and any more advanced topics when dealing with this kind of event alone for an element, or window object. advanced topics can be on things like simulating a click event.

### 2.3 - mouse buttons

There is often more than one mouse button to work with, as such this section will be on exploring how to make use of more than just the left click button.

## 3 - Simple Project Examples secitons

After the basic and advanced sections it gets to the point where the only thing the remains to do is to start having one if not more sections on simple project examples that are in tune with the over all theme of the post, in this case working with mouse and pointer input in general. As of this writing I am not planing anything when it comes to these kinds of sections at least for this post at least as I think I still need to focus on the advanced sections first.
