# js-javascript-example-game-framework

The aim with this JavaScript example is to create the first of what might be a few JavaScript examples that are game frameworks. In my canvas example collection of posts I made a whole bunch of canvas examples, but each canvas example was for the most part its own independent thing. There are some good talking points to support this kind of approach to making canvas games, however I have found that I am pretty much done with making a canvas project from the ground up each time I start a new game prototype, let alone a complete project.

There are many frameworks made all ready to choose from, but thus far I have found that I do not like the lack of control. So then if I want to have a framework, but maintain control, then it would seem that I just need to make my own framework.


## Core Features of this framework

This game framework has a number of core features that just about any game framework should have which include.

* a state machine
* a stack of canvas layer objects using a canvas module
* create points to be used in rendering using the canvas module
* an object pool module
