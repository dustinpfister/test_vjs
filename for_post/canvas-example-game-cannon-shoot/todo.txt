## Canvas Example game cannon shoot todo list

* (done) get basic structure together
* (done) add bounding box to utils object
* (done) add distance method to utils
* (done) fireShot method that sets mode to fired, and sets starting pps and heading of the shot object
* (done) main update state method, and update methods for aim, fired, and over modes
* (done) Basic event attachment for the canvas element worked out for mouse and touch events
* (done) when in aim mode there is a fire button that will cause the game to enter fired mode with current cannon values
* (done) need an x and y offset value for the state
* (done) grid drawn at all times
* (done) grid state changes depending on x and y Offset.
* (done) shot position should just be the center of the canvas, the offset position is what should be set and changed
* (done) shot heading should change based on current power, and the rate at which power is lost
* (done) need a t variable for each update call
* (done) update shot by way of its pps value rather than the static delta
* shot stops when it hits the ground
* draw the ground
* have an draw.debug method
* shot power loss is based on something like pps of the shot

* cannon power set by distance from bottom left of canvas
