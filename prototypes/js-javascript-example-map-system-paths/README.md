# js-javascript-example-map-system-paths

I would like to have a stand alone folder for the map module that I was using in my turn based rpg. In order to gain a better sense of what will need to be added to my map menu I will also be making a basic game that will serve as a demo of the map module. The game should be very simply, but still allow for a need to add some basic features to the map.js file that will likley be needed not just for this game but all other games that I might make in the future that will make use of this map librray.
