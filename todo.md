## CURRENT STICKY PROJECT

I should have one "STICKY PROJECT" at any given moment that I will tend to work on at least a little every day. It would be best to keep it as just one project, but I can also list some candidates here when it comes to changing what the current sticky project is.

### js-javascript-example-orb-module

I would like to keep working on my orb module, and also the basic game that I have started in that module called orb match that will be the first game making use of the orb module. Keep the game as simple as possible while working out what the features of orb.js should be for more complex games that might come to be later on with orb.js. If all goes well the orb match game might turn into a stand alone project outside of this repository.





## New for post folders

As of 8/2021 I am going to think more in terms of just writing one new post per week on Friday of each week, and focus more so on improving the quality of posts that I have wrote before hand. Still I do not want to stop writing new posts while I figure out a better plan for doing things.
