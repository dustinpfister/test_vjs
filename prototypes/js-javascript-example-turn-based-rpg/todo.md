## () - 0.8.0 - unit sub-types starting with enemy unit type
* I will want to have more than one type of the unit.type 'enemy' of course so then I am goinf to want to have some kind of sub type system
* maybe a standard like 'enemy.blob' to have a unit type of 'enemy' with a sub type of 'blob'
* when it comes to defining what a sub type is I might also want to have several 'variants' of a sub type such as 'enemy.blob.green'
* I think I will also want to have a way to set level by a type string also like 'enemy.blob.red.5'

```
{
  type : "enemy",                   // the unit type to append to "enemy"
  subType : "blob",                 // the sub type for the type collection "enemy.blob"
  variants : ["red", "green"],      // possible variants "enemy.blob.red", "enemy.blob.green"
  variantDefault : 1,               // default index in variants array to use if no variant type is given (default 0)
  rangeWeapons: [null, "fireball"], // ranged wepaons in the "items.weapon.ranged" db
  meleeWeapons: [null]
  sheetIndex: 5,                    // the sprite sheet index to use
  cellIndex: [0, 1],                // cell index values in the sheet for each variant
  create: function(api, enemy){     // what to do when unit is created for first time
      // by default a blob has no ranged weapon (rangeWeapons[0] === null)
      // but a red blob will be equiped with a 'fireball' ranged weapon
      if(blob.variant === "red"){
          blob.rangeWeapon = api.createRanged(1);
      }
  }
}
```
