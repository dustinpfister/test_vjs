# js-fetch

These are the source code examples that I am writing about in my [blog post on the fetch api](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/03/27/js-fetch/) in client side javaScript. This fetch method is a way to go about scripting http with promises out of the ate unlike other options such as the xml http request method.
