# js-math-round

This is a collection of source code examples on [rounding numbers in javaScript](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2020/06/15/js-math-round/). Of course this includes Math.round, as well as Math.ceil, and Math.floor. However it also involves a whole lot of other options on top of that such as the toFixed method of a Number, as well as custom vanilla javaScript methods for rounding that Might be needed in some situations.
