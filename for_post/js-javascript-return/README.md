# js-javascript-return

These are the source code examples for my post on the [javaScript return](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/03/01/js-javascript-return/) keyword. This return keyword is what to use in order to define some kind of return value for a function, which will default to an undefined value otherwise. There are many other topics that branch off from the return keyword though such as [implicit return values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#comparing_traditional_functions_to_arrow_functions) in arrow functions, and using the return keyword as a way to stop any additional code from running or escaping a loop in the body of a function. So this collection of examples is what I came up with when it comes to exploring everything that revolves around the return keyword in javaScript, as there is only so much to write about when it comes to the keyword itself.
