# js-javascript-example-grid-game-unit-movement

This is the source code folder for the javaScript example that I am writing about in my [post on javaScript grid unit movement](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2020/08/11/js-javascript-example-grid-game-unit-movement/). The style of unit movement in this example has to do with a kind of turn based system rather than a real time system of some kind. So then this is in no way any kind of definitive example of unit movement in a client side javaScript game, by rather just one system for a certain kind of game, and even with this it might not be the best choice for all projects.

The example first started out as just a simple system involving the position of a player unit in a grid, and just moving that player unit by figuring out what the angle is from the current positon and a position that was clicked by making use of the [Math.atan2 method](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/03/19/js-math-atan2/). From there as of revision 3 forward I have added basic path detection to the example, that allows for setting one or more cell locations in the grid as not being walkable. After that I have got into the habit of making addtional improvments and bug fixes to this example, inclduing suport of having more than one map that compoese a kind of game world in which the player unit can move that was added in revision 4 of the example. Further improvements and features are planed, but I think I will be stoping short of going the full distance with this as the aim is to make some kind of system in which to base one or more games rather than make a full finished single game with this.
