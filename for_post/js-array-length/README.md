# js-array-length

The subject of array length in javaScript is not always as simple as one might assume at first. One major reason what is because in javaScript plain old arrays created with the Array constructor, or the array bracket syntax are sparse arrays. The length property is then just a sign post of sorts, but there could be a whole lot of nothing between and element index value and that sign post. So there is a difference between the length of an array, and what many might call a count of an array. Further more when it comes to what a count is that can change depending on what it is that we are counting actually. So then this is a location of a whole lot of javaScript source code examples that have to do with [array length in javaScript to which I have wrote a blog post on](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2018/12/14/js-array-length/).
